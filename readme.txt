How to use:
(So far the manual input is the only input that works.)
In the input box, type the command in the following syntax [BotName] [Command].
Punctuation can be used.
The options can be used, however it is having FileIO problems at the moment.
The About contains information about the program and contains thanks to the open source projects that were kind enough to give their APIs for free.
