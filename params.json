{"name":"Alfredproject","tagline":"The offical repo of the Alfred Project","body":"# Alfred Project\r\nAn old AI project that I developed early in high school to try and compete with Siri (a lone competitor in the market at the time). I realized Siri, in all its ambition, was buckling on its own weight. Thus, I had based the project idea on 3 fundamental basis:\r\n\r\n## Accessibility\r\nI wanted to make something that was more than a huge block of code. Everything throughout is highly commented and my full intentions with the code can be seen.\r\n\r\n## Usability\r\nI wanted to make a piece of software that even a child could use, but also a piece of software that a developer wouldn't feel unsupported in using. Thus, I began my quest, researching UI constructs and the ideas that are behind a good GUI. In its current state, the UI is probably the best part, fully capable of many of the functions needed to make the software accessible.\r\n\r\n## Modularity\r\nI wanted it to be able to be modular, so it would be able to inject code from other sources. A bit ambitious considering my limited programming skills at the time.  In its current state, it has the backbone of a structure allowing it to be modular, however, I never spent too much time working on this aspect.\r\n\r\n##Current State\r\n- [x] TTS (Text to Speech) [output]\r\n\r\n- [ ] STT (Speech to Text) [input]\r\n\r\n- [x] Recognition of strings\r\n\r\n- [x] manual input\r\n\r\n- [x] web based uses\r\n\r\n- [x] time and date\r\n\r\n- [ ] Modular implementation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Anything that was too ambitious\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
