<p>An old AI project that I developed early in high school to try and compete with Siri (a lone competitor in the market at the time). I realized Siri, in all its ambition, was buckling on its own weight. Thus, I had based the project idea on 3 fundamental basis:</p>

<h2>
<a id="accessibility" class="anchor" href="#accessibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accessibility</h2>

<p>I wanted to make something that was more than a huge block of code. Everything throughout is highly commented and my full intentions with the code can be seen.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usability" class="anchor" href="#usability" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usability</h2>

<p>I wanted to make a piece of software that even a child could use, but also a piece of software that a developer wouldn't feel unsupported in using. Thus, I began my quest, researching UI constructs and the ideas that are behind a good GUI. In its current state, the UI is probably the best part, fully capable of many of the functions needed to make the software accessible.</p>

<h2>
<a id="modularity" class="anchor" href="#modularity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modularity</h2>

<p>I wanted it to be able to be modular, so it would be able to inject code from other sources. A bit ambitious considering my limited programming skills at the time.  In its current state, it has the backbone of a structure allowing it to be modular, however, I never spent too much time working on this aspect.</p>
